</p>

<div style="font-size: 15px;">
    <ol>
	    <li>Go under &quot;For Owners&quot; and select Add/Drop option.</li>
	    <li>As your 1st waiver, pick a player under &quot;Select Player to Add&quot; and then pick your IR Player under &quot;Select Player to Drop&quot; 
            from your roster.</li>
	    <li>Verify &quot;Add this claim to round&quot; is showing round 1.</li>
	    <li>Add a note (required) in the &quot;Comments&quot; box about the IR player move; for example D. Walker on IR or J. Hill on IR.</li>
        <li>Click &quot;Perform Add/Drop&quot; button.</li>
	    <li>Continue to add all your waivers under round 1, by picking a &quot;Select Player to Add&quot;, followed by &quot;Select Player to Drop&quot; and clicking &quot;Perform Add/Drop.&quot;  Repeat for addition waivers.</li>
	    <li>Next, from the &quot;CURRENT WAIVER CLAIMS FOR...&quot; atop the page that shows 
            your current waivers, go under Action and click on "Copy to Round 2" for each waiver move you want to add to 2nd round.</li>
	    <li>That&#39;s it!</li>
    </ol>

	How does all this work?&nbsp; Simple, after the waiver wire deadline passes, all IR requests are manually processed and then credited; these are not viewed as normal waivers.&nbsp; Once IR move 
    are completed, IR waiver is dropped from your 1st round and all remaining waivers bubble up when the waivers are processed. Keep in mine that if you add your IR move in the 1st round and add your waivers in the 2nd round, the system will not move waivers from round two to round one.  So there&#39;s a real good chance you will not get your players.&nbsp; It happens every year and as long it&#39;s not a system error, the ruling on the field stands!&nbsp; If you are unsure, please send
    us an email.
