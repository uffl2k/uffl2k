        <p>
        This year&#39;s drafts will run from Sunday August 23<sup>rd</sup> and concluding on Wednesday September 3<sup>rd</sup>, 
            2025.&nbsp; All dates and times will be posted on the web site league&#39;s calendar and via email.

            <font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Preparing for the Draft</em></font></h2>
        <p>
            Planning for the draft makes the difference between having a mediocre team or having
            a team that can go the distance and win a Super Bowl. Taking the time to research
            players, their teams, schedules, bye weeks and stats will give you the upper hand
            in drafting NFL players. There are many different types of Fantasy Football magazines
            available at your local book store, TV talk shows and the internet. &nbsp;These are just
            a few ways to help you prepare and achieve the winning edge over your opponents.
        </p>

    <b><i><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font></i></b>
    <blockquote>
        Depending on the number of owners, division alignments will be as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Up to 72 owner league.</li>
            <li>One conference with up to 9 divisions.</li>
            <li>8 owners per division (10 owners maximum).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The League will do it&#39;s best to accommodate you by division with owners you would enjoy playing against. Hopefully this will make for a more enjoyable
            season.</p>

        <p>
            Before the draft starts we will go over this year&#39;s rules and answer any questions.
            Every owner should come prepared with a list of NFL players at each position so
            that he or she can keep track of who has been drafted and which players are still
            available to select from. Owners will draft their players in proper order taking
            approximately one minute per pick. The average time to complete a draft is about
            two to three hours long.</p>
        <h2>
            <strong><em><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Setting up draft order</font></em></strong></h2>
        <p>
            <font size="3">Each owner in their respective divisions, by a show of hands, will vote
                on a draft format shown below.&nbsp; In case of a tie, draft type will be drawn
                from a hat or by other means.&nbsp; Each draft type is explained below and all owners
                should be familiarized with each style prior to draft day; as follows:</font></p>
        <ul>
            <li><font size="3"><b>Reverse</b> - Every other round is reserve to the prior round,
                i.e., round 1 = 1-8, round 2 = 8-1, round 3 = 1-8, and etc.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3"><b>Random</b> - each owner draws a number from
                a deck of cards, one thru the number of owners in a division. This number will become
                the position in which an owner will draft in the first round and then it becomes
                your assigned position throughout the remaining rounds.&nbsp; To help all owners
                drafting strategy, all 16 rounds will be determine before hand.</font></li>
            <li><font size="3"><b>Serpentine - </b>a combine format of Random All and Reverse.&nbsp;
                All odd rounds are randomized with the even rounds in reverse order.<br />
                <i><b>Example</b>:&nbsp; round 1 = 1-8, round 2 = 8-1, round 3 = 4-3, round 4 = 3-4,
                    round 5 = 6-5, round 6 = 5-6, and etc.</i></font></li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <p>
            <font size="3">One important key in fantasy football is not to draft too many players
                on the same bye week. If you were to draft a starting QB from the New England and
                your second QB from the Baltimore Ravens, each having the same bye week, you would
                score zero points for the position. Another scenario many owners tend to make
                is drafting to may players from same bye weeks, which weakens your changes of winning
                your match up.&nbsp; Mixing your roster with players throughout the thirty-two NFL
                teams will help to eliminate the possibilities of this situation from occurring.</font></p>

            <font size="3">A team roster will consists of a total of 16 players.&nbsp; The table below shows

                time of email will be the deciding factor if both players went on season ending IR on the same day.&nbsp; 
                Otherwise, email will follow Add/Drop rules.</li>
            <li>Two (2) rounds will be conducted each week during the regular season. Team in last place from each 
                respective division will have the first pick and first place having the last pick. Second round 
                will follow first round draft order.</li>
            <li>One (1) round will be conducted for the first two rounds of league&#39;s playoffs.  Week 12 final standing will  
                determine Add/Drop order for the two rounds of the playoffs; last place team from each respective division will

            <li>During the league&#39;s playoff (weeks 15 thru 17), Add/Drop is open for season ending IR, released, or 
                retired players moves ONLY!<br />
                <strong><font color="red">Note: </font></strong>TMQB and TMPK position are eligible for season ending IR moves during weeks 15 thru 17.</li>

        <p>
            Not all owners will draft players in a given week. The outcome of this will not change the order of the draft. 
            For example, if the first top five owners (1-5) submitted a free agent requests and the last five teams (6-8) 
            do not, the draft would start with the fifth place team going first.

            What is a Pick&#39;em Pool? The general concept for this pool is to correctly pick
            the winners of each game each week of the NFL regular season. Each correct team
            you select scores you a win (ties are consider a loss). The owner with the most
            wins at the end of week 18 is declared the winner.
        </p>

        <strong>Notes:</strong>
        <ol style="margin-top: 0;">
            <li>Pool incurs additional fee of $25 to play.</li>
            <li>Distribution and number of top finishes will be based on the amount of owners participating.</li>
            <li>All pool picks are hidden from view until kickoff of each game. This prevents one
                from seeing other owners selections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Picks that have been submitted and where games have not been started are displayed
                as an asterisk (&#42;).</li>
            <li>Pool concludes at the end of the NFL regular season, which is week 18.</li>

    <blockquote>
        <p>What is a Survivor Pool? Each owner picks a winner from one NFL game for the upcoming week of the season. If one picks correctly 
            and has less than 2 losses, he or she moves on and&nbsp; picks in the following week. If you pick incorrectly twice, you&#39;re 
            out and cannot pick in any subsequent weeks. The twist, an owner may only pick an NFL team once for the entire season. The last 
            owner left is declared the winner. Distribution is based on the amount of owner involved.

            <li>Distribution will be based on the amount of owners participating.</li>
            <li>Your pick can be submitted until the kickoff of the last game of the week.</li>

            <li>Incorrect pick, no selection made or game ends in a tie is viewed as a lossing pick.</li>
            <li>Owner is eliminated from the pool with 2nd loss.</li>
            <li>If a winner cannot be determine at the end of week 18, distribution will be divided among owners who have the least amount of losses.<br />
                <em>Ex: After week 18 concludes and there are 2 owners with 0 losses and 3 with 1 loss; distribution will be split among the 2 owners with 0 losses.</em></li>
